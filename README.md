# Island Generator

This project utilizes a Perlin noise library to generate a height map of values from -1 to 1. Assigning colors to different value ranges helps simulate elevation levels. With a few tweaks of the scale and offset, the resulting archipelagoes look great!

Like any other project, there are many improvements I would like to add:

  * Use another Perlin height map to apply biome details
  * Generate clouds
  * Add simulated ship trade routes
  * Create a gif of a rising tide around the beaches
